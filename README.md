Employee Payroll System

Overview

The Employee Payroll System is a Python program that calculates the amount that a company has to pay its employees based on the hours they worked and the times during which they worked. The program reads the employee schedules from a file and calculates the payroll based on the day of the week and time of day, according to a table of rates.

The program consists of a main Python script and several classes and functions that implement the logic of the program. The program uses object-oriented programming principles to encapsulate the logic of the program into reusable and testable objects.
